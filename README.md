 A project that aims to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask in an image using Deep Learning Techniques. Transfer Learning is used for prediction using MobileNet, Alex Net and Yolov5 with different variations. A custom CNN is also built with 128 layers and comaprison of all the performances is made to choose the best fitting model for the dataset.
